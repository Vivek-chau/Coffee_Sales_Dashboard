Recommendations:
As per the given data I have discovered some trends which are shown in the Coffee Shop Sales dashboard.

1. The best selling hours are from 7am to 10am, By improving the marketing strategy for coffee at these hours would be a good decision for more sales as coffee is more preferable.
2. Focus on High Footfall Locations.
3. Boost Low Performing Locations.
4. Consider expanding the product lines of the top 5 products by introducing new flavors, sizes, or variations.
5. Need to focus on weekdays more as Monday and Friday are good for sales as per given data.
